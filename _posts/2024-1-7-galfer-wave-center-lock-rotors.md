After putting nearly 6,000 miles on these through lots of gravel, hard braking, and wet conditions, I can confidently recommend these rotors. Not only do they look fantastic, but they are the same weight as the super expensive Carbon-Ti rotors (and even lighter in the center lock variety).

Measured weights:
- Center Lock 140mm: 75g
- Center Lock 160mm: 96g
- Combined: 171g
