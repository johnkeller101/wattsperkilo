The Xpedo Thrust SL is the lightest look-keo stype pedals on the market by a good margin. I've had experience with Xpedo before, with their light mtb pedals to mixed success, so I decided to take the plunge and order a pair from Amazon International for $227.44 (which is far less than their website).

## Early Issues

The first week or two was great. No issues clipping in or unclipping, and the adjustment for when you need to unclip was handy to have (and I maxxed it out so it is very hard to unclip). At week three (around ~1k miles), I ran into issues with the bearings in my pedals. One of the pedals was creaking when standing, and when spun on the bike stand, the pedal made a grinding noise. One of the bearings was shot, but to me that was an incredibly short lifespan for bearings. I decided to hope that it was a manufacturing issue, and make a warranty claim. They had me send them out without any promise of fixing at my own expense. Turn around time was quick at one week, but I wasn't happy to have to send them in and gain some grams when it was peak summer here in Boulder. Luckily I had an old pair of Assioma pedals to use as a backup.

## Continued Issues

The pedals came back and the issue was fixed. Both the spindle and body looked to not be replaced, so I guessed they must have done something with the bearings. There was still some grinding feeling when spinning one of the pedals, but I figured it wasn't a big issue and that they fixed them, right? Lo and behold, another week or two and the creak came back.

The bearings which were causing the most issue for me were the larger ones, so I decided to replace them all on my own and pack the pedals with a lot of grease in hope that would solve the issue. That worked for a few rides, but then the brand new bearings were shot.

I decided to send them in for repair, again. I pleaded with the support person to cover shipping, and they did relucantly. So off they went again. This time, they replaced both pedal bodies, and it seems I got a revisioned body. The metal washer was now longer, and actually prevented any side to side play, which seemed to be an oversight in the first version I had.

Anyways, the new pedal bodies worked great. There was still issues with one of the bearings, so I replaced them to pre proactive. I had bought [a kit of 10 bearings](https://amzn.to/3MJSA22), so figured I might as well use them. Anyways, another thousand miles and they started creaking. This time when I was in Spain and without replacement bearings. On the spot, I ordered some new pedals, which will be talked about in a future post.

## Bad Tollerances

My analysis is that between the pedal body and spindle, there are bad tollerances all around which are wrecking the bearings. I've given up. I have extra bearings to replace, but I would have to replace them proactivly every 1000 miles (or less). For a [$255 MSRP pedal](https://xpedo.com/product/pedals/road/thrust-sl/), this is pretty unacceptable.

## Verdict

Do not recommend. Unless you like replacing bearings, or having creaking on your group rides.
