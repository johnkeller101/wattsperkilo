Welcome to Watts Per Kilo, your ultimate resource for weight-conscious cycling product reviews. I'm John Keller, a retired continental pro cyclist with a passion for optimizing performance. My cycling journey began in 2018 with the CU Cycling Team, where I evolved into the road captain. In 2020, I transitioned to gravel racing, earning a spot in the Life Time Grand Prix race series and the UCI Road Team Illuminate. Notable 2021 achievements include 3rd at Big Sugar, a solo 150-mile triumph at Rad Dirt Fest, and an 11th place at Belgian Waffle Ride with the coveted King of the Mountains award. In 2023, I've also conquered notable Boulder KOMs, including Magnolia, Sugarloaf, Chapman, NCAR, and Superjames (Jamestown to top).

At Watts Per Kilo, it's more than just a review site; it's a community of cyclists seeking optimal performance. Join me as we navigate the world of lightweight cycling gear together. Whether you're a seasoned rider or just starting, Watts Per Kilo is your hub for informed decisions and a shared passion for faster, lighter rides. Here's to elevating your cycling journey.
